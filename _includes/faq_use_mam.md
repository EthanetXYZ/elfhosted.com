### Use {{ page.meta.slug }} with MyAnonamouse (MaM)

MaM has particularly stringent rules regarding the source IP of your traffic. Since our torrent clients already require a VPN connection, we comply with the one-IP-per-account rule, but since VPN IP changes when the pod restarts, we've had to make some allowances for updating your "dynamic seedbox IP".

Here's [a thread in the MaM support forum](https://www.myanonamouse.net/f/t/74263/p/1) illustrating how to integrate ElfHosted apps with MaM.

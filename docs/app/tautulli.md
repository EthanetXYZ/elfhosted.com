# Tautulli

## What is it?

Tautulli is a 3rd party application that you can run alongside your Plex Media Server to monitor activity and track various statistics.

## How do I use it?

Once you've enabled it in [your account](https://elfhosted.com/tenant/apps/0), launch the app via your dashboard.

You'll be prompted to setup "login with Plex", and then connect to your plex instance (see [Interconnecting-Apps](/Reference/Interconnecting-Apps))

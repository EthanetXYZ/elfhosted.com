Wallabag is an popular, open-source read-it-later app, like Instapaper or Pocket, but yours to control!

wallabag extracts the article's content (*and only its content!*) and displays it in a comfortable view. Moreover, wallabag is responsive: you can read your articles on your smartphone or your tablet.

If you already have data on PocketÂ©, ReadabilityÂ©, InstapaperÂ©, PinboardÂ©, Firefox or Chrome, you can import your data into wallabag: add easily thousands of articles in your account.

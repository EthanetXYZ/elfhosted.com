## How do I use it?

Once you've enabled it in [your account](https://elfhosted.com/tenant/apps/0), launch the app via your dashboard. 

You'll need to subscribe to RPBD via Patreon in order to get an [API key](https://ratingposterdb.com/api-key/).

Once you've entered your API key into the UI, use the "Add Movie Folder" or "Add Series Folder" button to add a folder.

Instead of browsing for a folder, click in the text box illustrated below..

Manually type in the path to your movie/series folder (starting with `/media/`), and click "Save Location":

# SABnzbd

## What is it?

SABnzbd is a popular usenet client

## How do I use it?

Once you've enabled it in [your account](https://elfhosted.com/tenant/apps/0), launch the app via your dashboard.

Most of the configuration is already fine-tuned for our enviornment (so take care making changes!), but you'll want to configure your own news servers before NZBGet will download anything.

## How do I get support?

1. For general use of the application itself, refer to the [upstream project](https://sabnzbd.org) or the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/sabnzbd).
2. For specific support re your ElfHosted configuration / account, either consult the #[elf-friends](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1118645576884572303) channel, or call for [#elf-care](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1119478614287712337).

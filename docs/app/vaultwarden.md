# Vaultwarden


## What is it?

Alternative implementation of the Bitwarden server API written in Rust and compatible with upstream Bitwarden clients.

## How do I use it?

Once you've enabled it in [your account](https://elfhosted.com/tenant/apps/0), launch the app via your dashboard. 

## Is it backed up?

No. You can back it up yourself from `/config/vaultwarden` using [FileBrowser](/Apps/FileBrowser)

## Can you see my passwords?

No, your data is encrypted client-side. All we do is host the database. You can confirm this, by backing up your data, and examining it (see above).

## How do I get support?

1. For general use of the application itself, refer to the [upstream project](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden)
2. For specific support re your ElfHosted configuration / account, either consult the #[elf-friends](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1118645576884572303) channel, or call for [#elf-care](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1119478614287712337).

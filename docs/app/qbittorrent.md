# qBittorrent

## What is it?

The qBittorrent project aims to provide an open-source software alternative to ÂµTorrent.

## How do I use it?

Once you've enabled it in [your account](https://elfhosted.com/tenant/apps/0), launch the app via your dashboard.

## How to I connect it to my apps?

See [here](/Reference/Interconnecting-Apps) for details.

## Private vs Public trackers

The default qBittorrent instance is restricted to whitelisted-only, private trackers. You can request a private tracker be whitelisted, by creating a support ticket.

If you require **public** tracker access, there's a dedicated `qbittorrentpublic` app available, which is slower, but unrestricted in terms of public/private trackers.

## Alternate themes

Our qBittorrent apps include the popular [VueTorrent](https://github.com/WDaan/VueTorrent) alternative theme, which can be enabled in by setting "Use alternative Web UI" to `/vuetorrent` as illustrated below:

# {{ page.meta.slug }}

Joplin is an open source note-taking app. Capture your thoughts and securely access them from any device, with syncing and publishing provided by Jopin Server.

{% include 'app.md' %}
{% include 'app_access.md' %}

### What's my password?

The default username `admin@localhost`, and the password is `admin` (*change this after logging in, obviously!*).

If you change your email address (*and you should*), Joplin will try to send you an email to verify your address. Email doesn't work (*Joplin Server is a "at home" version of the paid JoplinCloud service*) so click on Admin -> Email, examine the email queue, find your confirmation email, and click on the link yourself :)

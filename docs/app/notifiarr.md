# Notifiarr

## What is it?

Notifiarr is a client interface for Notifiarr.com, a fancy thing-doer for integration with the various apps, as well as with a Discord server.

## How do I use it?

Once you've enabled it in [your account](https://elfhosted.com/tenant/apps/0), launch the app via your dashboard.

If necessary, use FileBrowser to navigate to `/config/notifiarr` and adjust the config, and then trigger an app restart by either shutting it down (it'll auto-restart), or restarting it from your user dashboard.

## How do I get support?

1. For general use of the application itself, refer to the [official wiki](https://notifiarr.wiki/).
2. For specific support re your ElfHosted configuration / account, either consult the #[elf-friends](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1118645576884572303) channel, or call for [#elf-care](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1119478614287712337).

Rclone is the defacto tool for managing multiple remote storage endpoints

## How do I use it?

When you first load the Rclone UI, you'll be prompted for a password. Enter any user/pass (*they're not validated*) to login.

### Set bandwidth limit

From the dashboard, set a reasonable bandwidth limit to avoid impacting all users:

### Add remotes

Use the UI to add and test your remotes (S3, dropbox, etc)

### Add alias remotes for local mounts

In order to interact with locally-attached mounts (storagebox, elfstorage, etc), you'll need to add each as an "alias" remote. The process is illustrated below:

### Transferring data

Use the "Explorer" interface in split-screen mode to open two remotes at once, and then drag/drop folders between them to trigger a transfer:

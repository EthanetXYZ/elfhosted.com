# Plex

## What is it?

Plex is a power media player with support across a large range of platforms

## How do I use it?

Once you've added your [plex claim](https://www.plex.tv/claim/), and enabled it in [your account](https://elfhosted.com/tenant/apps/0), launch the app via your dashboard.

You'll be prompted to setup your libraries, etc.

### From media players

When you configure your Plex app in your media player, use `https://<username>.plex.elfhosted.com` as the address (*if a port is required, use `443`*)

# Prowlarr

## What is it?

Prowlarr is an indexer manager/proxy built on the popular arr .net/reactjs base stack to integrate with your various PVR apps. Prowlarr supports management of both Torrent Trackers and Usenet Indexers. 

It integrates seamlessly with Lidarr, Mylar3, Radarr, Readarr, and Sonarr offering complete management of your indexers with no per app Indexer setup required (we do it all).

## How do I use it?

Once you've enabled it in [your account](https://elfhosted.com/tenant/apps/0), launch the app via your dashboard.

Prowlarr will be pre-configured for the other supported apps.

If your indexer requires your external IP (for *indexer access*, not torrent access), use `45.35.195.242`

## Troubleshooting

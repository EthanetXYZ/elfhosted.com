# {{ page.meta.slug }}

ruTorrent is a popular Bittorrent client for power users, which includes the unique ability (*among our torrent apps*) to create torrents from its web UI.

## How do I use it ?

### Set inbound port

If you're using Private Internet Access, or ProtonVPN, then your inbound port will be automatically configured for you.

If you're using a different VPN provider, you may need to manually configure a port assigned to you by your VPN provider. In this case, use [FileBrowser][filebrowser] to create `/config/rtorrent/forwarded-port-override`, populated with the port number you'd like rtorrent to listen on.

Restart rutorrent using [ElfBot][elfbot], and the port will be fixed at the one you specified.

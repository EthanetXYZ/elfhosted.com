# NextPVR

## What is it?

NextPVR provides IPTV support for Jellyfin/Emby/Plex

## How do I use it?

Once you've enabled it in [your account](https://elfhosted.com/tenant/apps/0), launch the app via your dashboard.

The default login is:
* Username: `admin`
* Password: `ireadthedocs`

## How do I connect it to my apps?

See [Interconnecting Apps](/Reference/Interconnecting-Apps) for details

## Can I save recordings?

No, you can't currently. Although NextPVR _thinks_ it has access to a `/recordings` and `/buffers` folder, these are limited to 1GB, and exceeding them will cause the pod to restart.

## How do I get support?

1. For general use of the application itself, refer to the [NextPVR wiki](https://github.com/sub3/NextPVR/wiki).
2. For specific support re your ElfHosted configuration / account, either consult the #[elf-friends](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1118645576884572303) channel, or call for [#elf-care](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1119478614287712337).

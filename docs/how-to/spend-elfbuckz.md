# ElfBuckz

"ElfBuckz" is our "in-store credits" system, and is the preferred way to pay for daily app subscriptions[^1]

Every new user receives $1[^2] ElfBuckz on account creation, which is enough to run [Radarr][radarr] for 20 days, or [Plex][plex] for 6 1/2 days.

## ElfBuckz Balance / Topup

To see your ElfBuckz balance, visit your [account page](https://store.elfhosted.com/my-account/account-funds/). From here you can perform a one-time topup, but you can also [subscribe to a monthly topup](https://store.elfhosted.com/product/elfbuckz-topup/).

## Spending ElfBuckz

Simply use ElfBuckz as your payment gateway when buying app subscriptions. Provided you have a positive balance, the apps subscriptions will renew daily :thumbsup:

[^1]: Because payment processors won't let you bill $0.05/day, apparently!
[^2]: $10 during beta-testing in June 2023

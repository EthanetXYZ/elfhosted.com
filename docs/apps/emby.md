# Emby

## What is it?

Bringing all of your home videos, music, and photos together into one place has never been easier.

## How do I use it?

Once you've enabled it in [your account](https://elfhosted.com/tenant/apps/0), launch the app via your dashboard.

You'll be prompted to configure your admin account, setup your libraries, etc.

### From media players

When you configure your Emby app in your media player, use `https://<username>.emby.elfhosted.com` as the address (*if a port is required, use `443`*)

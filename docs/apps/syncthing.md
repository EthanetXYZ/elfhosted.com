# Syncthing

## What is it?

Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. It synchronizes files between two or more computers in real time, safely protected from prying eyes. Your data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored, whether it is shared with some third party, and how itâ€™s transmitted over the internet.

## How do I use it?

Once you've enabled it in [your account](https://elfhosted.com/tenant/apps/0), launch the app via your dashboard. 

## How do I get support?

1. For general use of the application itself, refer to the [upstream project](https://syncthing.net/) or the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Syncthing/).

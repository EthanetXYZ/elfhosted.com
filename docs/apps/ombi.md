# Ombi

## What is it?

Ombi is a self-hosted web application that automatically gives your shared Plex or Emby users the ability to request content by themselves!

## How do I use it?

Once you've enabled it in [your account](https://elfhosted.com/tenant/apps/0), launch the app via your dashboard. You'll need to perform the initial setup, creating at least your admin user, and connecting to your apps of choice (*see [Interconnecting-Apps](/Reference/Interconnecting-Apps)*)

## How do I get support?

1. For general use of the application itself, refer to the [upstream project](https://ombi.io/) or the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ombi/).
2. For specific support re your ElfHosted configuration / account, either consult the #[elf-friends](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1118645576884572303) channel, or call for [#elf-care](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1119478614287712337).

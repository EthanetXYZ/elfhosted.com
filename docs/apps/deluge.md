# Deluge

## What is it?

Deluge is a lightweight, Free Software, cross-platform BitTorrent client.

## How do I use it?

Once you've enabled it in [your account](https://elfhosted.com/tenant/apps/0), launch the app via your dashboard. 

The default credentials are:

* user: `deluge`

## How to I connect it to my apps?

See [here](/Reference/Interconnecting-Apps) for details.

## Private vs Public trackers

The default Deluge instance is restricted to whitelisted-only, private trackers. You can request a private tracker be whitelisted, by creating a support ticket.

If you require **public** tracker access, there's a dedicated `delugepublic` app available, which is slower, but unrestricted in terms of public/private trackers.

## How do I get support?

1. For general use of the application itself, refer to the [upstream project](https://deluge-torrent.org/).

# ruTorrent


## What is it?

ruTorrent is a popular Bittorrent client for power users, which includes the unique ability (*among our torrent apps*) to create torrents from its web UI.

## How do I use it?

Once you've enabled it in [your account](https://elfhosted.com/tenant/apps/0), launch the app via your dashboard.

## How to I connect it to my apps?

See [here](/Reference/Interconnecting-Apps) for details.

## Private vs Public trackers

The default Deluge instance is restricted to whitelisted-only, private trackers. You can request a private tracker be whitelisted, by creating a support [ticket](https://discord.com/channels/907016842873278474/973816812351389726).

If you require **public** tracker access, there's a dedicated `rutorrentpublic` app available, which is slower, but unrestricted in terms of public/private trackers.

## How do I get support?

1. For general use of the application itself, refer to the [upstream project](https://github.com/Novik/ruTorrent).
2. For specific support re your ElfHosted configuration / account, either consult the #[elf-friends](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1118645576884572303) channel, or call for [#elf-care](https://discord.com/channels/396055506072109067/1119478614287712337).

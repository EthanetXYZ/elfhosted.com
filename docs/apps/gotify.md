# Gotify

## What is it?

Gotify is a simple server for sending and receiving messages. You can connect it to several apps, and use it as a destination for notifications, avoiding traditional notification channels like Telegram, Pushover, Discord, etc.

With the installation of the [Android app](https://github.com/gotify/android), it's possible to receive push notifications from your Gotify instance.

## How do I use it?

Once you've enabled it in [your account](https://elfhosted.com/tenant/apps/0), launch the app via your dashboard. 

The default credentials are `admin/admin`

## How do I get support?

1. For general use of the application itself, refer to the [upstream project](https://filebrowser.org).

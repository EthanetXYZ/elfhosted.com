# Resilio Sync



## What is it?

Resilio Sync allows you to sync files between devices on a local network, or between remote devices over the Internet via a modified version of the BitTorrent protocol. 

## How do I use it?

Once you've enabled it in [your account](https://elfhosted.com/tenant/apps/0), launch the app via your dashboard. 

Upon launch, you'll be prompted to create a username/password. Once this is completed, you'll need to login again using the credentials you created.

# July 2023 - what a ride!

I've just finished putting together our progress report for July 2023. The report details all the changes we went through during the months (*more than I remember!*), and summarizes our various metrics (*CPU, Network, etc.*)

Of particular note is that we generated **actual** revenue during July 2023 (*puny, but I'll take it!*)

# "Elf-Disclosure" for October 2023

We've been in prod for 3 months now, and like September, October was mostly spent on bugfixes and backend improvements,  which I'll detail below.

Here are some shiny stats for October 2023, followed by a summary of some of the user-facing changes announced this month in the [blog](/blog/)...

## Resources

=== ":material-cpu-64-bit: CPU"

    Most apps consume almost no CPU while idle - the larger consumers are streamers doing transcoding, and download clients doing download/unpack operations. 
    
    Average CPU utilization increased roughly 30% from last month.

    ![CPU stats for October 2023](/images/reports/2023-10/cluster-cpu-utilization.png)

    Last month (Sep 2023)'s for comparison:

    ![CPU stats for Sep 2023](/images/reports/2023-09/cluster-cpu-utilization.png)


=== ":material-memory: RAM"

    This graph represents memory usage across the entire cluster. By far the largest consumers of RAM is rook-ceph. Like CPU utilization, there appears to be no month-on-month growth this month, but this data was recorded **after** deprovisioned accounts were pruned, so it's likely that actual **used** RAM has increased.

    Last month (Sep 2023)'s for comparison:

    ![Memory stats for September 2023](/images/reports/2023-09/cluster-memory-utilization.png)

=== ":material-server-network: Network"

    I'm not sure these stats are accurate, they've likely overly high because pods on the host network (*like metallb, ceph, etc*) will end up counting **all** traffic on each host, rather than the pod itself. However, the graph still gives a good indication of network usage compared to the previous month.

    The network graphs indicate a 3-4 x increase in network usage, which is consistent with the much higher traffic graphs for October, compared to September.

    ![Network traffic for October 2023](/images/reports/2023-10/cluster-network-utilization.png)

    Last month (Sep 2023)'s for comparison:

    ![Network traffic for Sep 2023](/images/reports/2023-09/cluster-network-utilization.png)

=== ":octicons-graph-16: Ingress/Egress"

    These are the traffic stats for egress from Hetzner. They exclude any traffic to/from Hetzner Storageboxes.

    Network traffic increased 100% from the previous period, although it's notable that the large spike from Oct 15 to Oct 25th was the likely cause, rather than a steady-state increase.

    ![Hetzner traffic stats for October 2023](/images/reports/2023-10/monthly_traffic_graph.png)

    Last month (Sep 2023)'s for comparison:

    ![Hetzner traffic stats for Sep 2023](/images/reports/2023-09/monthly_traffic_graph.png)

=== ":simple-ceph: Ceph"

    Ceph provides our own storage ("[ElfStorage][elfstorage]"), typically used for long-term slow storage and seeding. While the read/write IOPS and throughput gauges below are useless for trending (*they're just a single point in time, I'm working on adding better metrics*), the capacity graph indicates that we've consumed 100% more capacity compared to the previous month.

## What's new?

### Plex BYOVPN saves the day

As threatened, Plex pulled the plug on Hetzner IP ranges, breaking any Plex services hosted on Hetzner **without** a VPN. 

Our users who migrated to a Plex VPN solution were not impacted, and I've now removed the non-VPN Plex product from the store, so any future Plex subscriptions will require a VPN.

More details in [this blog post](/blog/2023/09/15/adding-byo-vpn-to-plex/).

### Radarr upgraded to v5

Radarr v5 has been released, and we automatically got the updated (*albeit a few weeks late, because config file changes meant our images builds were failing!*)

More details in [this blog post](/blog/2023/10/26/radarr-now-v5/).

### Low ElfBuckz balance notifications

Cosplaying a PHP developer, I altered our ElfBuckz (account credits) plugin to send email notifications when your ElfBuckz balance drops below $2. Aside from some flakey maths at first, this seems to be working well now, and is hopefully part of the reason for the uptick in revenue this month (*rather than either turning off services or failing to properly deprovision them!*)

More details in [this blog post](blog/2023/10/10/elfbuckz-low-notifications/).

[^1]: Much of this is yearly fees for Wordpress plugins
[^2]: Yes, that's a **lot**! This is the opportunity cost, over a month, of focusing on ElfHosted rather than billable consulting work!
[^3]: Total spend includes yearly payments for Wordpress plugins, etc
[^4]: All moneyz are in US dollarz!
[^5]: In Sept 2023, I changed the way these are counted, prefering users with active subscriptions rather than simply counting users provisioned (*also, deprovisioning was improved*)
[^6]: After inactive / abandoned accounts were deprovisioned

# Refund Policy

### 7-Day Trial Period

Shared appbox slots are covered by a 7 day money back policy. You can order any of our shared services and use it as a test. You can cancel it within the first 7 days and we will refund your money. Please note these refunds are pro-rate based within first 7 days. 

Our 7-day trial period may only be used a maximum of one time, per person. If it has been discovered that the user has created multiple accounts to circumvent this restriction, ElfHosted reserves the right to deny your request for a refund.

Furthermore, in the event of a violation of the Acceptable Use Policy or the Terms of Service, the customer agrees to forfeit all right to a refund.

### Cancellation Refunds

Following the 7-day trial period, we do not generally refund cancelled contracts. For example, if your contract is quarterly and you request a refund after two months, no refunds will be admitted.

In the event of an Acceptable Use Policy violation, the customer agrees to forfeit all rights to a refund.

### How to Request a Refund

To request a refund of a server within your 7-day trial period, please open a ticket at our [Discord Server](https://discord.elfhosted.com). In this ticket, please explain your reason for cancellation and ask for a refund. Additionally, you may also remove your credit card or paypal subscription via your user dashboard which will no longer renew the service with ElfHosted.

Your cancellation request will be processed as soon as possible. Following this, your funds will be returned to you however they were received.
